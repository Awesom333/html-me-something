        <p>The possibilities of coding are near boundless. The tech industry 
         has a plethora of moves to make in terms of innovation. I am someone 
         with a significant amount of interest; that being the case coding can 
         be a way to apply a multitude of those interest in a relevant fashion.
         Here I'd like to explore my previous fascination with poetry. I wrote
         a lot while I was in high school and regret, in some ways, stopping. I
         shall reiterate a promise to myself...
        </p>

        <p>For the longest time
           I've sought to be useful
           The thought was so sublime
           Not succeeding made me rueful

           Now here I am years later
           Always feeling relativily old
           I'm unwilling to meet my maker
           Until I've used my starting gold

           With each skill I build
           The closer to whole I'll be
           I shall never yield
           Until I am free

           To the future self, I say now
           This is my solemn vow...
        </p>

        <p>Believe it or not that was my first poem in over 12 years. I must say
           I'm quite proud of it. I cannot however forget what it means. Coding
           is yet another skill to complete a greater vision of myself. Something
           I think everyone should be able to have is self trust. Now I have a site
           in which I can visit in my low and high times. Thank you Launchcode!
