           down you can begin to look up! The world is your oyster. A personal poem awaits you below.

        <p id="poem"><img src="https://pics.me.me/you-are-super-duper-ama-zing-talented-go-getter-let-26534038.png" alt= "Smiley Face" style="float:right;width:500px;height:500px;">For the longest time<br>
           You've sought to be useful<br>
           The thought is so sublime<br>
           Not succeeding made you rueful<br>
           <br>
           Now here you are years later<br>
           Always feeling relativily old<br>
           Unwilling to meet your maker<br>
           Until you've used your starting gold<br>
           <br>
           With each skill you build<br>
           The closer to whole you'll be<br>
           Never shall you yield<br>
           Until you are free<br>
           <br>
           To the future self, you say now<br>
           This is your solemn vow...<br>
        </p>
        <img src="https://i.redd.it/ee2xeyqnu5wy.gif" alt="Believe in Yourself gif" margin-left:auto>
        <p class="paragraph1">Believe in yourself and the future will be bearable. Dreams will be fulfilled, and the world
           will be a better place. Make no your vitamin and press forward. Shoot for the stars, beacuse 
           even if you miss, you'll land amongst the stars. You're as limited as the universe.
